# Rust Webpack Bindings

---

TODO: Explain which files require

- which [bash] command to run
  - `wasm-pack build`
    - guessing all `*.rs` files in `src/`
    - lib.rs
- vs passive [hot reloading]
  - guessing that all files in `www/` are hot loaded

```bash

wasm-pack build --target web
npm install
npm run start

```
